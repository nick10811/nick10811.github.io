# I'm Just A Programmer

Welcome to **I'm Just A Programmer**. This is a place to record my technical articles. Every article is related to iOS development and which is my favorite topic recently.

This blog's theme is inspired by [Rhadow](https://rhadow.github.io). Which is made by [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and using [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme as a basic theme. You can build via `jekyll build`, and preview locally using `jekyll serve`.

> I made a shell file to build automatically.
