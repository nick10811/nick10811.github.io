Hello, my name is Nick. I am an iOS developer with a passion for developing innovative Apps. I use Swift or Objective-C to develop iOS/watchOS app and SDK. In addition, I have backend/frontend development experiences that involve RESTful Web Service and ReactJS. Recently, I focus on designing clean code architecture, such as MVVM, MVVMC, and improving teamwork to make team better.

I am interested for computer science, which attracts me to learn new things and participate in Responsible Research and Innovation(RRI). Please feel free to share and discuss with me if you have something innovative idea.
