Hello, my name is Nick. I am a software engineer. Although I like to develop iOS Apps, I am involved in backend and frontend developments as well. Those experiences helped me have a comprehensive insight into product development. As a team player, I am familiar to observe the circumstances of the team and propose my solution to improve teamwork. It is my pleasure if I can make team better.

I am interested for computer science, which attracts me to learn new things and participate in Responsible Research and Innovation(RRI). Please feel free to share and discuss with me if you have something innovative idea.
